Thank you for considering contributing to **LibraryConnect**! We're happy to accept contributions, whether they're bug fixes, new features, or documentation improvements. Please follow the guidelines below to make sure your contribution is a positive experience for everyone.

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Fork the Repository**

Start by forking the repository. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account where you can freely make changes.

To fork the repository, click on the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page.

### 2. **Clone the Repository**

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aeyouseff/LIBRARY-CONNECT.git
```

### 3. **Create a New Branch**

Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. This ensures that the main branch of the repository remains clean while you're working.

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

### 4. **Make Your Changes**

Make the changes you want to contribute to the project. You can add new features, fix bugs, or improve documentation.

- If you're fixing a bug, ensure that your code passes existing tests.
- If you're adding a feature, make sure it's well documented and tested.
- If you're working on documentation, ensure the content is clear and precise.

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**

Once you've made your changes, commit them to your branch with a clear, concise commit message describing what you've done.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change you're making"
```

### 6. **Push Changes to Your Fork**

After committing, push your changes back to your fork on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature-branch-name
```

### 7. **Open a Pull Request**

Once your changes are pushed, open a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to the original repository. Here's how to do it:

- Go to the repository where you forked the project.
- Click on the **Pull Requests** tab.
- Click on **New Pull Request**.
- Select your branch from the list of branches and submit the pull request.

In your pull request description, explain your changes, why you made them, and any related issues.

### 8. **Review and Feedback**

Once you open a pull request, the project maintainers will review your changes. They might ask for modifications, or they might merge your changes if everything looks good.

### 9. **Merge the Pull Request**

After your pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main branch of the project. You'll be notified once this happens.
